# Facial Recognition for Access Control  

## Project Overview  
This project explores facial recognition techniques for access control using machine learning. It implements computer vision models to detect and classify faces, with potential applications in security, parental controls, and attendance tracking.  

## File Description  
- **`Brian_Reppeto_DSC680_Facial_Recon.ipynb`**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the full implementation of the facial recognition system, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.  

## Key Components  
### 1. Data Preparation  
- Loading and preprocessing image datasets  
- Face detection using OpenCV  
- Data augmentation and normalization  

### 2. Model Architecture  
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  
- Transfer learning with pre-trained models (e.g., VGG16, ResNet)  
- Training and fine-tuning  

### 3. Evaluation & Performance  
- Accuracy and loss analysis  
- Confusion matrix and classification reports  
- Real-time testing using webcam input  

### 4. Use Cases  
- Secure access control  
- Parental restrictions for digital content  
- Attendance monitoring in classrooms/workplaces  

## Dependencies  
To run this notebook, install the required Python libraries using:  

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually install:  
```bash
pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## How to Run  
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Brian_Reppeto_DSC680_Facial_Recon.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the cells sequentially to process the dataset, train the model, and evaluate its performance.  
3. If using real-time face detection, ensure your webcam is connected.  

## Results  
- The trained model achieves **X% accuracy** on the test set.  
- The system successfully recognizes authorized faces with minimal false positives.  
- Further improvements include optimizing hyperparameters and expanding the dataset.  

## Ethical Considerations  
- **Privacy**: Ensuring user data security and consent.  
- **Bias**: Evaluating dataset fairness and reducing biases.  
- **Security**: Protecting against spoofing attacks.
