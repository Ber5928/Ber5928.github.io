    "## Project Subject Area:\n",
    "This project aims to analyze and derive insights from NFL data, incorporating information from three distinct sources: a flat file containing team data, an API providing game statistics, and a website with game schedule, betting stats, weather, and surface information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flat \n",
    "Description: A CSV file containing historical team data, including details such as team names, abbreviations, conference, and division information.\n",
    "Link: File:https://github.com/nflverse/nfldata/blob/master/data/teams.csv\n",
    "API (Sportradar):\n",
    "Description: The Sportradar API provides comprehensive NFL game statistics, team information, and potentially player-related data.\n",
    "Link: http://api.sportradar.us/nfl/official/trial/v7/en/games/7d06369a-382a-448a-b295-6da9eab53245/statistics.json?api_key=k8uqtrmhauf3rmkm6f8t9f54\n",
    "Website (Rotowire):\n",
    "Description: The Rotowire website offers valuable data on NFL game schedules, kickoff times, betting stats, weather conditions, and surface information.\n",
    "Link: https://www.rotowire.com/betting/nfl/archive.php\n",
    "Relationships:\n",
    "\n",
    "The flat file (teams.csv) likely contains information about NFL teams, which can be linked to data obtained from the API based on common team identifiers.\n",
    "The website (Rotowire) provides game schedule information, and it can be linked to both the flat file and API data based on game details, such as team names and dates.\n",
    "Project Approach:\n",
    "To accomplish the project milestones, I plan to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Merge the flat file with API data based on team identifiers.\n",
    "Combine website data with the merged dataset using game details.\n",
    "Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values and ensuring consistency.\n",
    "Analyze game statistics, team performance, and other relevant factors to derive insights.\n",
    "Visualize the results to provide a clear understanding of the trends and patterns.\n",
    "Interpretation and Challenges:\n",
    "The data collected will allow for a comprehensive analysis of NFL teams, game statistics, and related factors. Ethical considerations include ensuring compliance with data usage terms and respecting privacy regulations. Challenges may include handling discrepancies in data formats, potential inconsistencies in web scraping, and managing large datasets efficiently. Regular updates and communication with data providers will be essential to address any changes or issues that may arise during the project."
